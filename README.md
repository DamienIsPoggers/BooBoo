# BooBoo
### 2D Fighting Game engine

BooBoo is a 2D fighting game engine written in C# with [Raylib_cs](https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs) as the rendering backend and [NLua](https://github.com/NLua/NLua) for character scripting.

# Building

Building is quite simple. In Visual Studio, make sure you have [BlakieLibSharp](https://github.com/DamienIsPoggers/BlakieLibSharp) installed then just press build.

It hasn't been tested but it uses no platform specific code and should run on all platforms.
